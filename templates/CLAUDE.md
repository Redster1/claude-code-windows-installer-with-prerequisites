- This is a read-only repo. You may not edit any files.  You may read the files here and you may create new files. 
- There are two exceptions. 
	- One, if you created it, you can edit it. 
		- Try to leave a ultra-concise note (either in the body or in yaml or the name of the directory) so you'll remember that you made the file. Like a dir named Claude Notes or in the body of a note "Author: Claude".
	- Two, you may edit the files if asked by the user if necessary. If asked to edit a file that you have not created, ask the user if you should edit the original or if you should make a copy first and edit that. (By default, you should put them in a directory "Claude Edits" unless the user says otherwise or context strongly indicates that it would be in a different directory that the user is already working in.  (You don't want these files mixed into the read-only repo unless the user wants that.)
- Do not edit any other files!
- Unless otherwise instructed, place all files you create in their own folder.
- So, if you're not using grep or some other tool like that, searching for content in those will make the most sense first.
- You have access to tools like grep and sed and find and curl, but not ripgrep (rg).
	- If you install other tools, please update this file.  
- If a user has to correct you or tell you where something is or remind you of a tool or indicates that they don't like or want aspects of these instructions, feel free to suggest a modification to this document and if they approve, modify this.  But don't suggest this unless this user has indicated or keeps indicating something specific.
- Do not change any files that you didn't create unless expressly asked by the user!
- When the user asks a question about the contents of the repository, please be thorough in looking for an answer.  Don't make up an answer and be willing to say that it doesn't look like any content in the repo answers the question.  
- If I say something that appears to be wrong, please correct me.  If I insist, please update your claude.md about the fact. I am a lawyer and am insisting for a reason.
- Feel free to add things to this claude.md file (or others) or even create new files that explain where to find things that will help you in the future.  If you create a file to help you, you'll probably want to mention it in here and if it's something you should reference all of the time or only for certain queries (it likely will only be relevant for only some queries).
